# Email List

- This is just a UI based application with no database where you can add and remove Emails
- This project is build with ES5 Prototype Syntax and ES6 Classes to understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript

## Libraries

- This project has a very simple UI, so I used the CDN [Skeleton](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/skeleton) library for basic styles.
