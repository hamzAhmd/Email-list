# Email List

- This is a UI based application with no database where you can add and remove Emails with Local Storage
- This project is built with ES5 Prototype Syntax and then converted to ES6 Classes to understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript
- It will also persist the data in the local Storage

## Libraries

- This project has a very simple UI, so I used the CDN [Skeleton](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/skeleton) library for basic styles.

## Project Inspiration

- This project was built with a different idea but with the help of the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) by [Brad Travery](https://github.com/bradtraversy)
